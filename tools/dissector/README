Starting with release 2.1.1, OpenDDS provides support for Wireshark.
The OpenDDS DCPS dissector provides a Wireshark 1.2.x/1.3.x compatible
dissector which supports the TCP/IP, UDP/IP, and IP multicast transports.
Dissection of transport headers and encapsulated sample headers are fully
supported.

======================================================================
* Building the OpenDDS DCPS dissector

Follow the steps in the INSTALL file in the root of OpenDDS directory, along
with the steps here.

In addition, the Wireshark sources must be available and built locally
according to the Wireshark Developer's Guide (see above).

1. Set up the Build System to Build the Dissector

   Run the DDS_ROOT/configure script, passing these arguments:

     --wireshark=WIRESHARK_SRC
	 --wireshark2=WIRESHARK_SRC
       Where WIRESHARK_SRC is the location of the Wireshark source.

     --glib
       On systems where Glib installed is the same used by the Wireshark
       build.
     --glib=GLIB_ROOT
       Where GLIB_ROOT is the install prefix for Glib. If building on Windows,
       GLIB_ROOT is the location of gtk2 folder Wireshark creates in the
       wireshark-win32-libs or wireshark-win64-libs folder when it is built.
       Can be also be used on systems where the Glib installed is different
       than what was used to build Wireshark.

     --rapidjson
       If using Wireshark 1.12 or later and sample payload data dissection is
       desired. If RapidJSON is not installed on the system, it must be downloaded
       using:
         git submodule update --init --recursive
       which will place it in:
         DDS_ROOT/tools/IntermediateTypeLang/cpp/rapidjson

   If using Wireshark 1.x on Windows, then this must be specified:
     set WIRETAP_VERSION=<version of the wiretap DLL built by Wireshark>

   If using Wireshark 2.x on Windows, then the Wireshark Developer's Guide will
   have you build Wireshark outside the Wireshark source folder. You will need
   to pass the name of the build folder:
     --wireshark2_build WIRESHARK2_BUILD

   As of writing building Wireshark 2 on Windows puts libraries in
   WIRESHARK2_BUILD\run\RelWithDebInfo along with the application itself.
   This is handled by default, but if this is not true for some reason,
   the library location can be defined manually:
	 --wireshark2_bin WIRESHARK2_BIN


2. Build

   Build normally as described in the $DDS_ROOT/INSTALL document.

3. Install Plugin

   To install the dissector plugin, copy the plugin file  from
   DDS_ROOT/tools/dissector to one of the plugin directories listed in the
   Folders section in Wireshark's About Dialog which can be found in the Help
   menu. On Windows, the plugin file will be named OpenDDS_Dissector.dll or
   OpenDDS_Dissectord.dll. On UNIX-like systems it will be named
   OpenDDS_Dissector.so.

   See <https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChPluginFolders.html>
   for details on where Wireshark looks for plugins.

4. Run Wireshark

   setenv.sh or setenv.cmd must be sourced before running Wireshark or
   it will complain that it couldn't load the dissector if the OpenDDS
   libraries are not installed system-wide.

   You may verify the plugin is installed correctly by looking at the
   Supported Protocols list.  Depending on the wireshark version, this
   can usually be found somewhere under the Help or Internals menus.
   The OpenDDS_Dissector library we created above should appear in the
   list of plugins or protocols.

======================================================================
* Environment Variables

   OPENDDS_DISSECTORS
     If set the dissector will look for ITL files in that location
     to use for sample payload dissection.

   There are two environment variables the dissector will use for debugging:

   OPENDDS_DISSECTOR_LOG
     If set, the dissector will write log output to
     OpenDDS_wireshark.log in the current directory.

   OPENDDS_DISSECTOR_SIGSEGV
     If set, the dissector will not handle segfaults when they occur
     during sample payload dissection. If not set, a segfault will
     cause a dialog to appear to suggest that the ITL file is wrong
     and close Wireshark. Setting this might be more helpful if
     using a debugger to see where the segfault occurred.

======================================================================
* Available Display Filters

A number of display filters are supported by the OpenDDS DCPS dissector:

1. Transport header display filters

   opendds.version
     Revision of the DCPS protocol.

   opendds.byte_order
     Byte order of transport header contents.

   opendds.length
     Total length of payload, including sample headers.

   opendds.sequence
     Sequence number of transmitted PDU.

   opendds.source
     Source identifier; only used by the multicast transport.

2. Sample header display filters

   opendds.sample.id
     Message ID of sample (i.e. SAMPLE_DATA).

   opendds.sample.sub_id
     Sub-Message ID of sample (i.e. MULTICAST_SYN).

   opendds.sample.flags
     Flags field (see below).

   opendds.sample.flags.byte_order
     Indicates byte order of sample data.

   opendds.sample.flags.coherent
     Indicates sample belongs to a coherent change group.

   opendds.sample.flags.historic
     Indicates sample is historic; resent by DataWriter.

   opendds.sample.flags.lifespan
     Indicates sample defines a lifespan.

   opendds.sample.flags.group_coherent
     Indicates sample uses PRESENTATION.coherent_access.

   opendds.sample.flags.content_filter
     Indicates the publisher has applied filters for Content-Filtered Topics.

   opendds.sample.length
     Total length of sample data, not including sample header.

   opendds.sample.sequence
     Sequence number of transmitted SAMPLE_DATA.

   opendds.sample.timestamp
     Source timestamp of sample.

   opendds.sample.lifespan
     Lifespan duration of sample (iff lifespan flag is set).

   opendds.sample.publication
     Publication ID of transmitting DataWriter.

   opendds.sample.publisher
     ID representing the coherent group (if group_coherent flag is set).

   opendds.sample.content_filter_entries
     Number of entries in this list for filtering (if content_filter flag is set).

  See below for Filtering based on the sample payload.

======================================================================
* Available Color Filters

A set of color filters are included in the source distribution which may
be imported to highlight DCPS protocol packets.

To import these filters, click on the View -> Coloring Rules menu item,
followed by the Import button.  Select the colorfilters file in the
$DDS_ROOT/tools/dissector/ directory and click the Open button.

NOTE: Coloring rules are applied on a first match basis; you may need to
      move the imported rules above the "tcp" and "udp" rules using the
      Order buttons on the right-hand side of the dialog.  If ordering is
      changed, you must ensure the "OpenDDS (Important)" rule appears
      before the "OpenDDS" rule.

======================================================================

* Sample Dissection

The dissector, when configured with RapidJSON, can dissect sample data on
Wireshark 1.12 and later. To use this:

1. Export type information using the OpenDDS IDL compiler.  The
   command "opendds_idl -Gitl <filename>.idl" will produce a file
   called <filename>.itl which contains the necessary type
   information.  The new MPC base project "gen_dissector" may be used
   in MPC to add -Gitl to the opendds_idl command line.

2. Start wireshark in the directory containing the itl file or set the
   OPENDDS_DISSECTORS environment variable to the directory containing
   the itl file.  The OpenDDS Wireshark plugin will try to load all
   .itl files in either OPENDDS_DISSECTORS if specified or the current
   directory.

Type information is exported using Intermediate Type Language (ITL).
For more information, see
  <https://github.com/objectcomputing/OpenDDS/tree/master/tools/IntermediateTypeLang>.

======================================================================

* Sample Dissection Filtering

When the dissector can dissect sample data, it also allows Wireshark to filter
OpenDDS packets based on contents.

The base of this filter namespace is "opendds.sample.payload".
If the type "Messenger::Message" is being used by OpenDDS and the ITL
file is located in OPENDDS_DISSECTORS (or the directory Wireshark was started
in), then packets that carry this can be filtered by
"opendds.sample.payload.Messenger.Message". Further more packets can be
filtered by the data in the payload, for example:

  opendds.sample.payload.Messenger.Message.subject contains "DDS"
  opendds.sample.payload.Messenger.Message.count >= 4

See <https://wiki.wireshark.org/DisplayFilters> and
<https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark-filter.html>
for examples of how Wireshark display filters can be used.

Notes:

  - IDL Arrays and Sequences value is the number of elements:

      opendds.sample.payload.Messenger.Message.seq < 3

      This will show all OpenDD packets with a payload of type
      "Messenger::Message" where it's "seq" member has less than 3 elements.

    To filter the items inside use "_e" (element). Items can not be
    filtered by index of the elements:

      opendds.sample.payload.Messenger.Message.seq._e.some_value == 1

  - Values of Enums are represented by string names of the members. So if a
    Enum has a member "Invalid", then you can filter for packets with that
    value with:

      opendds.sample.payload.Messenger.Message.enum == "Invalid"

  - Union members are accessible by their name, not by their discriminator
    value. If packets have a Union u on a boolean member u_b that is true,
    then they can be found with:

      opendds.sample.payload.Messenger.Message.u.u_b == 1

  - Long Doubles are cast down to doubles.

  - Wide strings and wide characters are converted from UTF-16 to UTF-8 using
    iconv. Data that is invalid UTF-16 is replaced by a message saying that
    it was invalid and what kind of problem iconv had with it.

  - To retain compatibility with Wireshark 1.12, OpenDDS/IDL Chars are given
    to Wireshark as strings and must be filtered as such. This means that when
    filtering they must be typed with double quotes (") like a C string
    literal, not single quotes (') like a C character literal. The same
    applies to WChars, but that's because Wireshark does not have a dedicated
    wide character type.

======================================================================
* Known Limitations

  - OpenDDS only maintains wire compatibility with the current revision
    of the DCPS protocol.  This dissector is effective for the compiled
    protocol version only.

  - The sample dissector can not distinguish between two IDL types that
    have the same name. When using an ITL file that does not match
    what OpenDDS is using, the dissector will do one of following:
      - Cause Wireshark to crash, but a pop up window informs the user of the
        probable cause.
      - Mark the OpenDDS packet as malformed, which will be colored red.
      - Fill the sample payload fields with incorrect data, or omit fields
        entirely.
