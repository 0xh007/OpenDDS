Naming for Governance files:
AU / PU                  : Allow Unauthenticated / Prohibit Unauthenticated
UA / PA                  : Unprotected Access / Protected Access
ND / SD / ED / SOD / EOD : Not protected / Signed / Encrypted / Signed with Origin authentication / Encrypted with Origin authentication Discovery
NL / SL / EL / SOL / EOL : Not protected / Signed / Encrypted / Signed with Origin authentication / Encrypted with Origin authentication Liveliness
NR / SR / ER / SOR / EOR : Not protected / Signed / Encrypted / Signed with Origin authentication / Encrypted with Origin authentication RTPS

Naming for Topics:
OD / PD                  : Open / Protected Discovery
OL / PL                  : Open / Protected Liveliness
OA / RA / WA / RWA       : Open / Read / Write / ReadWrite Access
OM / SM / EM / SOM / EOM : Open / Signed / Encrypted / Signed with Origin authentication / Encrypted with Origin authentication Meta-data
OD / SD / ED             : Open / Signed / Encrypted Data

Note:
Governance files in the governance directory have been automatically generated using "governance/gov_gen.cpp".

In the unlikely event you need to build gov_gen, you should be able to simply run g++ to build it:
g++ -o gov_gen gov_gen.cpp -Wall -pedantic -std=c++11
