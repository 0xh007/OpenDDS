A test for Built-In-Topic (BIT) implementation.

The purpose of this test is to verify that newer and older participants
receive the same BIT data. prst_repo_run_test.pl does the same with
persistence enabled on the InfoRepos, shutting down the first InfoRepo,
starting a new one, and testing the BIT data with a new monitor.

Test steps:

1) start InfoRepo
2) start monitor1 process which just creates a domain participant. It reads
   bit data via bit datareader after a few seconds.
3) start publisher which creates a domain participant and a datawriter.
4) start subscriber which creates a domain participant and a datareader.
5) start monitor2 process which just creates a domain participant and reads
   the bit data via bit datareader.

The monitor1 and monitor2 should both get following bit info.

 4 domainparticipants,
 2 topics,
 1 datareader
 1 datawriter
