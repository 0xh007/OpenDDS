# Topic Type Annotation Compiler Tests

These test the use of topic type IDL annotations, such as `@key`.
They are tested with the classic IDL C++ mapping in `classic_landmap` and the
IDL C++11 mapping in `cpp11_langmap`. The two should test the same things, with
the only difference being the language mapping.
