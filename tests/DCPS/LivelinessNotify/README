Currently, the OpenDDS Liveliness does not account for automatic or manual liveliness,
and will instead notify all subscribers when the participant receives a liveliness
notification.  This test will create 2 participants. One participant will contain 2
writers, one which is automatic liveliness and the other which is manual liveliness.
The other participant will contain 2 readers, one which is automatic liveliness and
the other which is manual liveliness. The automatic writer will only associate with
the automatic reader, and the manual writer will associate with the manual reader. The
automatic reader will send a liveliness message letting the automatic reader know it
is alive.  The currently implementation of OpenDDS will incorrectly let the manual
reader know that the participant received a liveliness message, and the manual reader
will incorrectly assume that the manual writer is still alive, despite not receiving
a liveliness message in the time limit.
