To generate new data and image files based on a scoreboard test run directory:

1) Run:

./generate-test-results.sh <TEST_RUN_DIR>

which will create "<TEST_RUN_DIR>/data" with relevant data files (including json for website). And then,

2) Run:

./plot-test_results.sh <TEST_RUN_DIR> <OUTPUT_DIR>

where <OUTPUT_DIR> already exists... which will generate PNG files for website
